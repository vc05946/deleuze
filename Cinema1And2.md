# 『眼がスクリーンになるとき：ゼロから読むドゥルーズ『シネマ』』

## Introduction
For Deleuze as a philosopher, cinema is another nest for him to hide. As he said that he is a spider, while the light and sound make his threads vibrate. 
The vibration of the threads is the light and sound itself for Deleuze, as a spider, and he does not know anything besides the vibration. 

The viewer of cinema is a spider.

From here, it is the starting point for the cinema, straight to philosophy, and the one from philosophy straight to the cinema.

Cinema 1: The Movement Image (1983) - pre-war cinema, which is organic, aiming at the totality;
Cinema 2: The Time-Image (1985) - post-war cinema, which is inorganic, exposed to fragmentation;
