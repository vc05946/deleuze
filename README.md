I am actually a Lacanian, but I will still make an effort to study Deleuze, as it is an opponent of Lacan.

Firstly, I will start studying Cinema 1: The Movement Image and Cinema 2: The Time-Image, as one of my interests is cinema theories or studies. 
To get started, I will read 福尾匠 (a postgraduate in 横浜国立大学)　『眼がスクリーンになるとき：ゼロから読むドゥルーズ『シネマ』』， a wonderful introduction to these two volumes.
